# SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM-USING-IOT
This IoT-based system automates irrigation in nurseries and botanical gardens. Using an ESP8266, soil moisture sensor, DHT11, and a relay module, it monitors soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and weather forecasts to optimize water usage, reduce wastage, and enable remote control via a web interface.
